# Florida Drupalcamp 2017 Drupal 7 site

## FLDC17 Theme

The theme for this site was originally developed in 2014, and has served FLDC well for 3 years. In 2017, it has been slightly redesigned, but still has some 2014 cruft.

The theme is a subtheme of Omega4.

The Sass is compiled using Compass. A `Gemfile.lock` exists to allow you to use Bundler to download the Ruby dependencies.

CSS is committed directly to the repository.

## FLDC17 Data Model

The current "relativity" data model was created in 2015, and heavily utilizes nodes and entity references.
